This update has a lot of changes, so I probably forgot to list some of them.

* Removed the settings menu from the account page. It's now accessible from any page by clicking on the ESGST button.
* You can now enable features specifically for SG or ST in the settings menu.
* Revamped the settings menu and enumerated all settings, making it easier to reference them.
* All feature descriptions will now be accessible from the settings menu, without the need to keep going back and forth between the settings menu and the GitHub page (this is a work in progress, some features are currently missing their description).
* New features and functionalities will now be marked with a [NEW] tag, so it's easier to locate what's new in the current version from the settings menu.
* Started a process of cloning SG's classes so the script no longer needs to rely on them, which will prevent any possible conflict from SG's script (solves an issue that wasn't opening the header menu on Firefox, and another issue that was replacing the ESGST button with the profile button on ST).
* Optimized memory consumption and speed for sync, Game Categories and Created/Entered/Won Giveaway Details (possibly closes #220 and #222).
* Brought back avatars to Grid View.
* Giveaway Groups Loader now shows group avatars again.
* Improved how the groups are synced in Stickied Giveaway Groups and upgraded the group storage (unfortunately, unlike previous storage upgrades, this upgrade cannot retain your stickied groups, so you will have to sticky your groups again). You must sync through the settings menu (section 9) immediately, otherwise none of the group features will work correctly in this version.

* Comment Formatting Helper now checks to make sure the user entered the right format for encrypted giveaways (closes #225).

As a result, managing tags from the settings menu has been temporarily disabled until it has been rewritten for v6.
* Added options to manage user data individually to the settings menu (closes #139).
* Fixed an issue that was breaking discussion titles (closes #153).
* Disabled the giveaway panel, which makes the icons of the giveaway appear in the entries/comments row, if you don't have Giveaway Winning Chance, Giveaway Winning Ratio and Enter/Leave Giveaway Button, as these make the row too large with the icons in the default row.
* Corrected created time for the list of highlighted discussions (closes #155).
* You can now use the Enter key to save tags.
* If you hover hover whitelist/blacklist highlights, you will now see when you whitelisted/blacklisted that user (must be synced through the settings menu).

* Added the following features:

* Giveaway Grops Loader - Replaces Giveaway Groups Popup (can be added back if there is demand for it).
* One-Click Giveaway Hider (closes #156)

/*
 * June 12, 2017 - v6.Beta.4.8
 */

* Fixed an exploit that could be used to check all pages under "/discussions", "/users" and "/archive" in Whitelist/Blacklist Checker.

/*
 * June 12, 2017 - v6.Beta.4.7
 */

* Fixed some bugs.
* Added back the option to disable description popups to Enter/Leave Giveaway Button, but made the popups enabled by default.
* Fixed a bug in Comment Tracker that wasn't resetting the loading icon when using reverse order to find an unread comment.
* Fixed a typo in Comment Tracker (closes #154).
* Enhanced the option to mark all comments as unread in a discussion in Comment Tracker to prevent it from making any requests (closes #152).

Upgraded the following features to v6:

* Avatar Popout - Completely revamped the feature using the styling from SquishedPotatoe's dark theme (it might also be incompatible with the theme for the moment because of class name changing) (closes #67).

/*
 * June 12, 2017 - v6.Beta.4.6
 */

* Added additional information to error alerts, so that the users properly report errors when they happen.
* Reverted Comment History's default behavior to fading out.

/*
 * June 11, 2017 - v6.Beta.4.5
 */

/*
 * June 11, 2017 - v6.Beta.4.3
 */

* Fixed a couple bugs in Header Refresher on SteamTrades.

/*
 * June 11, 2017 - v6.Beta.4.2
 */

* Fixed a bug in Grid View.
* Added "Last Checked" information to the tooltip of Whitelist/Blacklist Checker and Not Activated/Multiple Wins Checker highlights (closes #142).

Upgraded the following features to v6:

* Comment Tracker - Fixed some bugs (possible solution to #134). Changed how the data is stored (your data should be transferred without any losses, but let me know about any missing data). You can now mark comments as unread (closes #128). Read comments and visited giveaways/discussions are no longer faded out - their background now changes to grey (possible solution to #143). The feature now works in the inbox page.
* Discussion Highlighter - You can now view your highlighted discussions through the Discussions header button (closes #133).

/*
 * June 11, 2017 - v6.Beta.4.1
 */

* Fixed a bug that was erasing game data when syncing owned games.

/*
 * June 11, 2017 - v6.Beta.4.0
 */

* Revamped Header Refresher to work better with Enter/Leave Giveaway Button and discontinued its support for Greasemonkey (if you are using Greasemonkey and you open multiple tabs, only one tab will refresh the header).
* Level Progress Visualizer now takes up the entire main button. As a result, the hover effect has been disabled.
* Giveaway Filters now has a separate setting for each of the giveaway pages (all, recommended, wishlist, group, new).
* Added some titles and tooltips to Giveaway Filters.
* Giveaway Filters now works if an advanced search was made, but the basic filters and the region restricted/dlc filters are disabled, as they are part of the advanced search.

Upgraded the following features to v6:

* Giveaway Winning Chance - Separated it into Giveaway Winning Chance and Giveaway Winning Ratio.
* Enter/Leave Giveaway Button - Fixed some bugs (closes #136 and #146). The feature now automatically detects if you own the game (you must of course sync through the settings menu) or if the giveaway is for a higher level than you and does not show the Enter button in case one of these is true (closes #132). Entered giveaways are now immediately hidden if the filter is enabled (closes #129). If an error occurs while entering a giveaway or if you don't have enough points, the button will simply turn red instead of adding an additional button to its side (partial solution to #89). Brought back the option to add a comment to the giveaway upon entering.

Added the following features:

* Quick Giveaway Browsing

/*
 * June 10, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.18
 */

/*
 * June 9, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.16

* Comment History has been completely revamped and there are now two different data storages (one for SG and one for ST). The new data storages should also take much less memory space.
* Fixed a bug in Game Categories that wasn't applying the negative class for "Rating" category.
* Added an option to Enter/Leave Giveaway Button to pop up the giveaway description in the same window instead of opening it in another tab.

 */

* Fixed some bugs and made some improvements.
* Changed how the game data is stored (your old data should be transferred without any problems, but let me know about any missing data).
* Fixed a conflict between games' app/sub ids. As a result, Multi-Tag and the option to import/export game data have been temporarily disabled until they are rewritten for the new system.
* Reinforced how the gama data is saved to further prevent data from being overwritten. As a result, you might notice that game features now take a bit longer to save.
* Added "Rating" and "User-Defined Tags" categories to Game Categories (closes #130).

Removed the following features:

* Giveaway Description/Comment Box Popup - Upon clicking the Enter/Leave giveaway button, the script now checks for a description. If it finds one, it opens the giveaway in a new tab so you can read it before entering, otherwise it enters the giveaway automatically.

/*
 * June 2, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.13
 */

* Added the option to show points in the title to Header Refresher, and the option to show an icon in the title to highlight new messages. The icon chosen was "fire", because you got new messages, so you're "hot". If anyone has a better suggestion, feel free to let me know.
* Separated the option to notify delivered gifts from Header Refresher back into Delivered Gifts Notifier.
* Fixed a bug in Endless Scrolling that was happening while refreshing a page.
* Fixed a bug in Giveaway Encrypter/Decrypter that was happening for giveaways with multiple copies.

/*
 * May 29, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.12
 */

/*
 * May 29, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.11
 */

* Header Icons Refresher, Points Refresher and Delivered Gifts Notifier have been merged into a single Header Refresher feature (see more details below).
* Endless Scrolling no longer alters the title/URL of the page.
* Added/changed some icons in the simplified version of Game Categories.

Upgraded the following features to v6:

* Header Refresher - If multiple tabs are open, only one tab will now make requests to refresh the header and then it will sync the changes with the other tabs (this happens instantly with Tampermonkey). The number of delivered wins will now appear in the title of the tab e.g. (2W). The icon of the tab is no longer changed, the message count will now appear in the title of the tab e.g. (5M). The level on SG and the reputation on ST are now refreshed as well, but they will not appear in the title of the tab. Points are updated instantly and refreshed across all open tabs when using Enter/Leave Giveaway Button with Tampermonkey (with Greasemonkey, it will still update, but only after 60 seconds). An example of all items combined: (2W) (5M) (150P) SteamGifts

/*
 * May 26, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.10
 */

* Added back the option to sync using the Steam API key, but made it optional. If there is a Steam API key saved, it will sync using both Steam API key and login, otherwise it will sync using only login.
* Added the option to enable a simplified version of Game Categories that can either show initials of the categories or icons (suggestions for the icons are always welcome, as I wasn't sure which icon to choose for some categories).

/*
 * May 26, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.9

 */

* Fixed a bug in Giveaway Encrypter/Decrypter.

* Added the option to highlight multiple wins as positive to Not Activated/Multiple Wins Checker, as multiple wins often cannot be fixed.
* Added the option to color the usernames instead of adding an icon next to them to Whitelist/Blacklist Checker. If this option is enabled, Not Activated/Multiple Wins Checker highlights will automatically appear as icons to avoid conflict.

/*
 * May 26, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.7
 */

* Your own comments are now automatically marked as read in Comment Tracker.

Renamed the following features:

* Exclusive Giveaways -> Giveaways Encrypter/Decrypter - This prevents any confusion about the nature of this feature. The giveaways are not really exclusive (anyone can see them in the source code of the page), this feature simply decrypts them and hands them over to the user (closes #125).

/*
 * May 23, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.3
 */
